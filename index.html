		<h2>What is a Bergamasco?</h2>
		<div><img src="img/bannerdog.jpg" alt="Bergamasco" class="displayed"></div>
		<p>The Bergamasco Sheepdog is a breed that is at least 2000 years old. The Bergamasco is a medium size dog, well-proportioned and harmonious, having a rustic appearance. He is a solidly compact dog with a strong, powerful build that gives him great resistance without taking away any of his agility or speed of movement. His imposing aspect is increased by the thick coat which is one of his typical characteristics and makes him different from any other dog. The Bergamascoâ€™s coat is characterized by three types of hair which are abundant and form mats or flocks, which are the distinguishing characteristic of this breed. The mats start from the spine and go down the flanks, growing every year to reach the ground. The thick curtain of hair that covers the eyes has a functional purpose as well; it serves as a visor so as not to be dazzled by the sun reflecting off the snow in the mountains. The color of the coat can be anything from gray or silver gray to anthracite (coal color). This color served as a camouflage when working in the mountains. The entire hereditary pattern is deeply ingrained in the breed.</p>
